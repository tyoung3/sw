## APIs

APIs are typically implemented via function calls, as stated in 
[altexsoft](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/what-is-api-definition-types-specifications-documentation/)
.  
We suggest most APIs would be better implemented by FBP.   


  * [Seven API challenges](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-seven-make-or-break-api-challenges-cios-need-to-address#)
  * [Everything an API](https://thenewstack.io/the-exploding-endpoint-problem-why-everything-must-become-an-api/)

The discovery, access, interface, and format of APIs are not standardized leading to fragmentation of programming languages, frameworks and developer consumption models such as containers and serverless as a way to deal with complexity. 

An existing functional API can be incorporated into a FBP component which interacts via one or more structures.   The component can thus 
simplify and tailor the functional API rules into a more standard API information packet.  When several, diverse functional APIs are required to carry out a particular operation, it may be possible to subnet the whole thing into one FBP process with a standard interface.  

Functional APIs, particulary web-based APIs with their inherent delays, would benefit immediately from FBP's inherent concurrency.
