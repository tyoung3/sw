Merge sends all data received on channels 1, 2, ..., N to 
channel 0. 

<p>Merge  creates N-1 goroutines, one for
each input channel.  Each goroutine sends its data to channel 0 and
completes when its input channel ends (EOF or error). 

<p>Merge waits for all goroutines to end, then closes channel 0 and ends.
